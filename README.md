# Design_and_UVM_Verification_of_Single_Cycle_MIPS
In this project, I implement a 32-bit single-cycle microarchitecture MIPS processor based on Harvard Architecture. The single-cycle microarchitecture executes an entire instruction in one cycle. In other words instruction fetch, instruction decode, execute, write back, and program counter update occurs within a single clock cycle.
The Processor is verified using 3 Programs 1-GCD of two numbers 2-The Factorial of a given number 3-Fibonacci Sequence
The Processor is also verified using Universal Verification Methodology By testing every instruction using Random Testing
